# Multi-Model Autonomous Driving

🚗 Building the Future of Autonomous Vehicles with Deep Learning 🤖

Welcome to the Multi-Model Autonomous Driving project! Here, we're on a journey to advance the world of self-driving cars using the power of deep learning and sensor fusion.

## Project Overview

In this repository, you'll find a comprehensive exploration of multiple deep learning models designed to enhance autonomous driving capabilities. We're not just building models; we're paving the way for safer, smarter, and more efficient autonomous vehicles.

### Key Achievements

- **Multi-Model Approach:** 📊 We've developed and tested various deep learning models to detect and classify traffic signals, spot obstacles, and identify lanes.

- **Comparative Study:** 📈 We've conducted in-depth comparative studies using prominent models like Mask-RCNN, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and MobileNet in realistic simulated environments.

- **3D Data Visualization:** 🌐 Our work includes KITTI 3D data visualization, which plays a pivotal role in understanding the vehicle's surroundings.

- **Algorithm Implementation:** 🤖 We've worked with various cutting-edge algorithms, including FCNN, DeepSort, MTAN, SFA 3D, UNetXST, and ViT, to improve vehicle perception.

- **Real Autonomous Vehicle:** 🚀 We've taken our knowledge and applied it to build a tangible autonomous driving vehicle. This real-world system uses Jetson Nano, Arduino, and Ultrasonic Sensors to detect lanes, avoid obstacles, and respond to traffic signals through deep learning and image segmentation.
